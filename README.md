# How to run the program
The program should run in an IDE that supports spring

I added a json.org dependancy to my pom.xml, if your json object/import is not being recognised 
right click on pom.xml > Maven and click reload project

If you json is still not being recognized add this dependancy 
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json You should need to do this but, just in case

## Classes to watch

JsonLogic,
Main

###### The program is currently partially done but I would love to work on it further. No testing has been implemented as program is still in development
